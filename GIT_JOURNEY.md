## Conflicts Resolved

### üß© Merge 1: `main` + `dev` (6 Files)

#### Conflict 1: `config/app-config.yaml`
- **Issue:** Production used port `8080`, development used `3000`
- **Resolution:** Created unified config with environment-based settings
- **Strategy:** Keep production as default, add dev as optional
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Time:** 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: `config/database-config.json`
- **Issue:** Different database hosts and SSL modes
- **Resolution:** Created separate profiles for production and development
- **Strategy:** Restructured JSON to support both environments
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Time:** 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: `scripts/deploy.sh`
- **Issue:** Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)
- **Resolution:** Added conditional logic based on `DEPLOY_ENV` variable
- **Strategy:** Made script handle both environments dynamically
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Time:** 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: `scripts/monitor.js`
- **Issue:** Different monitoring intervals and log formats
- **Resolution:** Environment-based configuration object
- **Strategy:** Used `process.env.NODE_ENV` to determine behavior
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Time:** 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: `docs/architecture.md`
- **Issue:** Different architectural descriptions
- **Resolution:** Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document
- **Strategy:** Created sections for each environment
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time:** 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: `README.md`
- **Issue:** Different feature lists and version numbers
- **Resolution:** Combined all features with clear environment labels
- **Strategy:** Organized features by category
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time:** 10 minutes

### ‚öôÔ∏è Merge 2: `main` + `conflict-simulator` (6 Files)

#### Conflict 1: `scripts/deploy.sh`
- **Issue:** Production logic vs experimental AI-driven deployment logic
- **Resolution:** Combined both under a unified deployment script with feature flags
- **Strategy:** Kept production stable as default, added experimental features behind flags
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Time:** 25 minutes

#### Conflict 2: `scripts/monitor.js`
- **Issue:** Simple production monitoring vs AI-enhanced predictive monitoring
- **Resolution:** Merged both by keeping stable code and adding AI mode under a config flag
- **Strategy:** Stable-first; experimental optional
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Time:** 20 minutes

#### Conflict 3: `README.md`
- **Issue:** Different documentation formats (basic vs extended dev features)
- **Resolution:** Combined into unified README with Production and Development sections
- **Strategy:** Clearly separated stable and beta features
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time:** 10 minutes

#### Conflict 4: `docs/setup-guide.md`
- **Issue:** Missing development steps in one branch
- **Resolution:** Added development setup instructions (`npm install`, `npm run dev`)
- **Strategy:** Preserve all stable production steps + include dev setup
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Time:** 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: `config/feature-flags.json`
- **Issue:** Feature toggles missing or mismatched
- **Resolution:** Created unified structure with default=false for experimental features
- **Strategy:** Maintain backward compatibility
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Time:** 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Issue:** One version had missing contribution guidelines
- **Resolution:** Merged both with clear steps for code style, branching, and PR process
- **Strategy:** Comprehensive documentation merge
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time:** 8 minutes

## üí° Most Challenging Parts

1. **Understanding Conflict Markers:**  
   Initially confused by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` symbols. Learned that HEAD refers to current branch and the other side is incoming changes.

2. **Deciding What to Keep:**  
   Choosing between conflicting logic required full context reading before merging.

3. **Complex Logic Conflicts:**  
   `deploy.sh` had different logic for production and experimental deployments; merged with conditionals and environment flags.

4. **Testing After Resolution:**  
   Ensuring that all resolved scripts actually ran correctly and didn‚Äôt break dependencies.

## üß† Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- Mastered manual conflict resolution  
- Learned `git diff` and `git log` usage for conflict tracing  
- Practiced advanced Git commands like rebase, stash, and cherry-pick  
- Improved understanding of Git internals and workflows  

### Best Practices
- Always read both sides before merging  
- Test before committing  
- Use atomic commits and descriptive messages  
- Rely on `git status` and `git reflog` for recovery  
- Document every resolution  

### Git Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are part of collaborative development  
- Merging carefully ensures quality and code integrity  
- Backups (`git stash`, `git branch backup`) are lifesavers  
- Never panic ‚Äî Git always has a way to recover

## ü™û Reflection
This challenge transformed my understanding of Git.  
Merge conflicts no longer feel intimidating ‚Äî they are simply opportunities to understand both perspectives of the code.  
I gained practical confidence in resolving complex conflicts, managing branches, and maintaining clean history.

The exercise taught me discipline: **read carefully, merge thoughtfully, test thoroughly.**  
Now, I can confidently say I‚Äôm ready to handle real-world multi-branch version control challenges in professional environments.
